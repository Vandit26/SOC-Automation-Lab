# SOC-Automation-Lab
# Objective
The objective of the SOC (Security Operations Center) Automation Lab is to develop, test, and implement automated processes and solutions that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of security operations. The lab aims to streamline threat detection, incident response, and remediation by leveraging automation tools and technologies. This will improve the overall security posture, reduce response times, minimize human error, and allow the security team to focus on more strategic tasks. Additionally, the lab will serve as a training ground for security professionals to develop and hone their skills in automation and advanced security operations. My main aim was to leverage this platform to develop practical skills in the automation of security operations.
